Nuvola Apps Changelog
=======================

  * Release announcements for users are posted to [Nuvola News blog](https://medium.com/nuvola-news)
    and social network channels.
  * Developers, maintainers and packagers are supposed to subscribe to
    [Nuvola Devel mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/nuvola-player-devel)
    to receive more technical announcements and important information about future development.

Release 4.7.0 - September 1st, 2017
--------------------------------

New Features:

  * New web app:  Jupiter Broadcasting by Andrew Stubbs.
  * The genuine flatpak builds offers free trial and $1/month subscription.
  * For sake of transparency, preferences dialog shows placeholders for features which were disabled by a distributor.

Bug Fixes:

  * VAAPI/VDPAU checks are not run under Wayland. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#280 Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#359
  * URL sandbox was not honoured properly: Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#367

News for Script Maintainers:

  * API 4.6 is required for new scripts.

Under the Hood:

  * Nuvola no longer bundles `*.vapi` files but depends on those of Valac 0.36.3. However, glib-2.0.vapi and
    webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0.vapi must be patched to work properly (see `vapi/*.patch`). You may need to
    modify wscript if you don't use Valac 0.36. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#369
  * Valac and GLib dependencies were raised to 0.36.3 and 2.52. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#369
  * GIR XML and typelib files are generated. Introduces new dependency on g-ir-compiler.
  * There was a lot of refactoring to allow usage of Python-GObject and to support multiple web engines in future.
  * Future warning: Nuvola is likely to introduce dependency on Python 3.6.

Release 4.6.0 - 29th July, 2017
-------------------------------

New Features:

  * Start-up system checks run in parallel to decrease start-up time. In case of any problem, only a single dialog is
    shown instead of multiple error dialogs or info bars.
  * WebKitGTK+ was upgraded to 2.16.6 fixing many security vulnerabilities and rendering issue.
  * Media Source Extension (MSE) is enabled in WebKitGTK as well as in Nuvola itself. This applies only to the genuine
    flatpak builds of Nuvola. MSE is required by some web apps for Flash-free audio/video playback.
  * New web app: BBC iPlayer by Andrew Stubbs. Note that this script requires MSE and may not work with third-party
    builds of Nuvola. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#321

Bug fixes:

  * Graphics.dri2_get_driver_name() now throws error instead of an uncaught critical warning if it cannot connect to
    X Server.  Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#359
  * Fixed typo in Nuvola.parseTimeUsec. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#357
  * int64 is used for track position to avoid integer overflow. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#358
    
News for Script Maintainers:

  * Developer sidebar can now change track rating.
  * Media player API documentation was updated with track rating.
  
Under the Hood:

  * New dependency: [unit.js](https://github.com/unitjs/unit.js/releases/tag/v2.0.0) 2.0.0
    (installed as /usr/share/javascript/unitjs/unit.js) is used for JavaScript unit tests
    (included in the test service - web_apps/test subdirectory).
  * Added support for org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.MediaKeys D-Bus name.
    [Upstream ticket](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781326).
  * The content of format support dialog was moved to Preferences dialog and various toggles were removed.
  * The content of bindings, models and interfaces directories was merged into components directory. 
    
Release 4.5.0 - 24th June, 2017
-------------------------------

New Features:

  * Nuvola Apps Runtime supports the integration of a progress bar and volume management. Web app scripts
    which use this feature can not only provide track length & position and current volume but also allow
    user to change that remotely, e.g. from Media Player GNOME Shell extension. At the present, only Deezer
    and Google Play Music scripts use these features but others will follow.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#22 Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#155
  * If Nuvola Apps Runtime detect a Nvidia graphics card, it checks whether the flatpak extension with 
    corresponding graphics driver is installed. If it isn't, e.g. because of a bug in GNOME Software,
    an error message is shown to provide the user with installation instructions. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#342
  * After a lot of effort, a workaround for the instability of Flash plugin was found out and is used until
    WebKitGTK developers find a proper fix. However, it is applied only in flatpak builds because it may have
    negative impact on other WebKitGTK applications otherwise. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#354

Bug fixes:

  * Wrong command in desktop launcher was fixed. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#348
  * Fix wscript for non-git builds. Issue: tiliado/diorite#16

News for Script Maintainers:

  * `Nuvola.API_VERSION_MAJOR` and `Nuvola.API_VERSION_MINOR` are now deprecated aliases of `Nuvola.VERSION_MAJOR`
    and `Nuvola.VERSION_MINOR`.

  * Added documentation of web app requirement flags.
  * Added documentation of user agent quirks.
  * New API for progress bar integration.
  * New API for volume management integration.

  * `Nuvola.triggerMouseEvent` and `clickOnElement` support relative x & y coordinates.

Under the Hood:

  * New dependencies: libdrm >= 2.2 and libdri2 >= 1.0
  * Nuvola checks whether VDPAU and VA-API drivers are installed and prints debugging information to console.
    It will show error dialog in the future though, so make sure the drivers are installed.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#280
  * Internal icon loading code was refactored. Legacy icon.png and nuvolaplayer3_XXX icons are no longer supported.
    eu.tiliado.NuvolaAppXxx is used everywhere. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaruntime#353

Release 4.4.0 - 27th May, 2017
------------------------------

New Features:

  * Tray icon feature can now use AppIndicator library instead of obsolete X11 tray icons. Although app indicators
    are mostly known from Ubuntu's Unity desktop, they also work in elementaryOS and GNOME Shell (with
    [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support)) and provide
    superior user experience. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#45
  * Users can easily clear cookies, cache and temporary files, IndexedDB and WebSQL databases and local storage
    from the Preferences dialog â†’ tab Website Data. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#331

Enhancements:

    as Nuvola 5.0.
  * Nuvola can do its own user agent quirks (i.e. to disguise itself as a different web browser) in order to work
    around web pages that doesn't work with the WebKit's user agent string. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336
  * Flatpak builds use the latest stable WebKitGTK+ 2.16.3 bringing fixes for three security vulnerabilities as well as
    several crashes and rendering issues.

Web App Scripts:

  * Google Play Music script uses own user agent quirks to work around the malfunctioning Google sign-in web page.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#336

Bug fixes:

  * The build script now raises error if it is ran with Python < 3.4.
  * Fixed a bug when the menus of tray icons and dock items were not updated.
  * Nuvola now aborts when required data files are not found (e.g. in incomplete installation) rather they running
    with errors in the background.
  * Obsolete test suite has been removed. A new one will be created during ongoing modernization.
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#335
  * Broken -L/--log-file options were removed. Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#338
  * Various fixes of HTTP Remote Control feature.

  * Nuvola's filesystem namespace was changed from `nuvolaplayer3` to `nuvolaruntime`. The data dir is installed at
    PREFIX/share/nuvolaruntime, libraries were renamed to `libnuvolaruntime-*.so` and binaries to `nuvola(ctl)`.
    Users' configuration, data and cache is migrated automatically.
  * Nuvola's git repository was moved to https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime.
  * WebKitGTK+ >= 2.16.0 is required as all new API is now used unconditionally to make maintenance easier.
  * Added optional dependency on appindicator3-0.1 >= 0.4. Use `./waf configure --noappindicator` to disable
    this dependency and related functionality (Tray icon feature).
  * Nuvola no longer bundles Engine.io-client JavaScript library but expect version 3.1.0 of it located at the
    JSDIR/engine.io-client/engine.io.js (JSDIR is DATADIR/javascript unless changed with --jsdir).
    Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#341
  * Nuvola no longer supports web app scripts without a desktop file.
  * Test suite was reintroduced (build/run-nuvolaruntime-tests). Issue: tiliado/nuvolaplayer#335
