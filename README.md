About Nuvola
------------

**Nuvola Apps Runtime™** is a runtime for semi-sandboxed web apps providing more native user experience and tighter
integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look
like a native application as much as possible.
Nuvola™ mostly specializes on music streaming web apps (e.g. Google Play Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer,
nd more), but progress is being made to support generic web apps (e.g. Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc.).

**Features of Nuvola:** Desktop launchers, integration with media applets (e.g. in GNOME Shell and Ubuntu sound menu),
Unity launcher quick list actions, lyrics fetching, Last.fm audio scrobbler, tray icon, desktop notifications,
media keys binding, password manager, remote control over HTTP and more.
