  <name>@FULL_NAME@ (web app runtime)</name>
  <summary>Tight integration of web apps with your desktop.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      @FULL_NAME@ is a runtime for semi-sandboxed web apps providing more native user experience and tighter
      integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look
      like a native application as much as possible.
      It mostly specializes on music streaming web apps (e.g. Google Play Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer,
      and more), but progress is being made to support generic web apps (e.g. Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Features: desktop launchers, integration with media applets (e.g. in GNOME Shell and Ubuntu sound menu),
      Unity launcher quick list actions, lyrics fetching, Last.fm audio scrobbler, tray icon, desktop notifications,
      media keys binding, password manager, remote control over HTTP and more. Some features may be not be available
      because of missing dependencies or were disabled by your distributor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Support: Users of third-party build should contact the customer care of their distributor.
