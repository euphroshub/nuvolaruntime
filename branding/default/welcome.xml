<p>
  You have installed <b>@NAME@ @VERSION@</b>. This software is based on the open source code
  from <a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/">Nuvola Apps™ project</a>, but may lack some of 
  <a href="https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/documentation/4/explore.html">the features available in the
  genuine flatpak builds of Nuvola Apps</a>.
</p>

<h2>About Nuvola</h2>
<p>
  <b>Nuvola™</b> is a runtime for semi-sandboxed web apps providing more native user experience and tighter
  integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look
  like a native application as much as possible.
  Nuvola mostly specializes on music streaming web apps (e.g. Google Play Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer,
  and more), but progress is being made to support generic web apps (e.g. Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc.).
</p>

<h2>Installation of Scripts</h2>
<p>
  Nuvola Apps project consists of the Nuvola runtime and various web app scripts (called Nuvola apps). Your distributor
  should provide you with information on what scripts are available and how to install them.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the genuine Nuvola builds by Tiliado are distributed as cross-distribution flatpak packages available at the
  <a href="https://nuvola.tiliado.eu">Nuvola Apps Repository Index</a>.
</p>


<h2>Get help</h2>
<p>
  If you experience any issues, please ask your distributor to provide you with support. Third-party builds of Nuvola
  are not covered by a limited free support provided by Tiliado. Alternatively, the Nuvola developer offers paid support.
